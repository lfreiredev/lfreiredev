ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Leonardo (@lfreiredev)!

I'm a Full Stack & Mobile developer based in Lisbon, Portugal.

I've been working as a developer for the past 6 years. Started freelancing in 2019 and switched full-time in 2021. During this time I've worked on a few projects:
- SOSvizinho (sosvizinho.pt) -> a platform that supports the organization with incoming help requests from risk group people and delegates them to the field workers. This project was born during the first 2020 lockdown in Portugal and helped people that couldn't leave their homes;
- Outstanding Portugal (outstandingportugal.com) -> a brand that assigns getaways in Portugal to people, according to a predefined budget, time, and interests. The backoffice allows them to have all information centralized in one place and act on it accordingly;
- An animal shelter project that allows searching animals for adoption;
- A radio mobile app;
- A personal website;
- A site to stream content for subscribers.

I've always been responsible and very hard-working. I learned leadership and teamwork by playing soccer for 12 years, way before starting my developer journey. Communicative, know how to listen, and embrace new members of a team with care.

I'm passionate about learning new stuff, not only related to software but also to finance, self-development, mental health, and crypto.
Enjoy reading a good book, praise exercising, and working with music in the background.

Love analyzing data and seeing facts through numbers:
- SOSvizinho gathered 3910 volunteers, helped over 300 people, and had a team of over 50 people, all around the country.
- Played soccer for 12 years straight. Met hundreds of different faces. Collected some friendships for life.
- The streaming site has dozens of monthly subscribers.

I'm neither a night owl nor an early bird. Most productive during the morning, creativity kicks in during the afternoon, and love to write at night.

The current stack is:
- NodeJS
- MSSQL
- PostgreSQL
- Angular
- Flutter
- Azure Pipelines
